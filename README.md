# JavaScript Gradient Descent Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm in JavaScript. The Gradient Descent algorithm is an iterative optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning and numerical optimization. It is used to find the minimum of a function by iteratively updating parameters based on the gradient of the function.

**How It Works**

The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters and a cost function. It calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters and updates the parameters in the direction of steepest descent. This process is repeated until convergence or a predefined number of iterations.

The Gradient Descent algorithm is widely used in various machine learning tasks, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It allows for the optimization of model parameters to minimize the cost function and improve the model's performance.
